## Implemented a student management system to apply **ADO.NET** concepts learned during the **Egypt Digital Pioneers initiative**. This project involved database connectivity, data manipulation, and real-time data retrieval, which enhanced my understanding of ADO.NET while allowing me to develop practical skills in database management and backend development.
### Key Features:  
- *Database Connectivity*: Implemented seamless connection to a relational database.
  
- *Data Manipulation*: Enabled efficient retrieval, insertion, and updating of student records.
  
- *Practical Learning*: Strengthened my understanding of backend development and database management using ADO.NET.  

This task enhanced my technical skills and provided hands-on experience with real-world applications of database interaction in .NET.
